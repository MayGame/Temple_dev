/**
 * Alg:
 * get customer ID or make one
 * per agent of interest, get related classifiers, applicable to that customer
 * Utility of having certain stuff with a chain-proof of utility
 * 
 * Concepts:
 * There are other agents of interest, who might want our customer to have certain things
 * Customer has a few classifiers applied to him, or in the most simple case, just one - their ID
 * There are rules to check ...
 * 
 * Example: We want certain person to be able to get a bread for free in one of a few shops.
 * These shops have a data entry, a way to identify that person. 
 * E.g. loyalty cards linked to their phone number.
 * Then it's as follows:
 * person shows their ID, system acquires all the additional IDs for each of utility providers, pulls linked data
 * 
 * then we can get classifiers for each individual good,
 * calculate total utility of that person having it as our utility of these agents being happy and value of that action to them.
 * (Contest mode - optional): one with bigger utility of having it gets it. Alternatively, they can increase it by giving us something that we need 
 * (e.g. money). That's how the price gets calculated in the end.
